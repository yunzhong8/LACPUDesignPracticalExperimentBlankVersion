2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
SYNTH-5#1 Warning
Mapped onto distributed RAM because of timing constraints  
The instance cache/cache_table_item/cache_way_item0/d_reg_reg_0_127_0_0 is implemented as distributed LUT RAM for the following reason: The timing constraints suggest that the chosen mapping will yield a better timing.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-5#2 Warning
Mapped onto distributed RAM because of timing constraints  
The instance cache/cache_table_item/cache_way_item0/d_reg_reg_128_255_0_0 is implemented as distributed LUT RAM for the following reason: The timing constraints suggest that the chosen mapping will yield a better timing.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-5#3 Warning
Mapped onto distributed RAM because of timing constraints  
The instance cache/cache_table_item/cache_way_item1/d_reg_reg_0_127_0_0 is implemented as distributed LUT RAM for the following reason: The timing constraints suggest that the chosen mapping will yield a better timing.
